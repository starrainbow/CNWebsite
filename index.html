        <p>Hi, my name is Sarah Banks and I am a qualified Nutritionist with over 20 years experience of treating the whole family. I graduated from Chester University in 1997 with a Postgraduate Diploma in Public Health Nutrition and I am registered with the Association for Nutrition. I am fully compliant with the Data Protection Act 2018.

        <h1>My Approach</h1>
        <p> I take a holistic and evidence-based approach to health, focusing on the root cause of any imbalance rather than just the symptoms. I offer general advice aimed at preventing illness and promoting good health and wellbeing, as well as more personalised advice tailored to individual need. I recognise that no one dietary or lifestyle programme fits all, so I will create a personalised plan which works with your personality and daily commitments, so that you'll find it easy to maintain long-term. I use psychological coaching strategies to empower clients to make positive lifestyle changes. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Tests</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> Where appropriate, I can organise relevant laboratory tests to be carried out to identify any biochemical imbalances in the body.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Supplements</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> Nutritional supplements are only recommended on the basis of clinical need and the latest evidence-based research.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Ongoing Professional Development</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> As part of my ongoing continuing practice development, I have attended numerous training courses over the years including those with specific focus on diabetes, weight control and digestive health.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Consultations</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> Consultations can be face-to-face, online or over the telephone. I provide email support post-consultation to ensure you stay on track with your health goals.
