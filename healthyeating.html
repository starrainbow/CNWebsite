        <p> A well-balanced diet provides you with all the energy and nutrients you need in order to stay active, strong and healthy. It helps to prevent diet-related illness and to maintain a healthy weight and a robust immune system. There can be a number of reasons why people find it difficult to eat well, including a lack of knowledge, cooking skills and time. I can provide you with all the knowledge you'll need and a personalised plan to help you improve your eating habits and maintain the changes.
